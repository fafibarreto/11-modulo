        <h1>Planning to create websites.</h1> <br>

        

        <h2>A guide for website creation.</h2>

        <p>You're probably reading here because you're thinking about creating a new website, if it's the first time:</p><br>

        <p>Building a reliable and professional website requires a lot of knowledge in some areas like design,
        communication, marketing, technology, usability, programming. You don’t need to be an expert in all areas
        but it is essential to have a good idea or count on someone who can help in the development.</p>

        <p>There is also no recipe for success, but a set of good practices that when well executed
        potentiate the chances of you building a powerful website. And in the first step, in this post we’ll talk about
        the basic steps of planning.</p>

        <h3>Planning</h3>

        <p>Overview and prototype of the site.</p>
        <p>It is a very comprehensive step because it is in it that all aspects of the project should be defined and it is
        fundamental
        start answering some questions like:</p><br>

        <h4>1.Who will access the site? </h4>

        <p>What would be the profile of the audience that would be interested in accessing your site and obtaining information or
        even buy your products?.</p>

        <p>The main thing in this step is to know and try to understand as much as possible the potential users of your site, what
        they do, what kind of language would be more appropriate to speak directly to them?</p><br>

        <p>Would these people see your site more on their computer or smartphone? Look for accurate information at
        trusted sources, access direct and indirect competitor sites, evaluate desing, interaction, time of
        response, language and...</p>

        <h4>2.What type of website is most appropriate?
        Whether it will be an institutional website, a blog, a portal, a virtual store, among others.</p>

        <p>Do you need to provide only your basic contact information? Need to publish content
        constantly? Need to sell through the site? Need to connect people? Provide some online service?</p><br>

        <h4>3. What features will be required?</h4><br>
        <p>Does your website need what features to be relevant to your users?</p>

        <p>You will need, for example, an internal search engine, a contact form, an interactive map,
        image gallery? The ideal is to raise and classify the references.</p>

        <h4>4. Begin the production!</h4>
        <p>With the answers to the questions above, surely the idea of where you want to go will be clearer. Then you
        Can you sketch your project?</p>

        <h3>you can begin:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Draw the structure of your website in hand or in any graphic production software of your.</li>
            <li>Prepare texts for all pages and sections of the site.</li>
            <li>Search or generate photos or videos to enrich the site's content.</li>
        </ol>
